As part of this update, we are also updating the Events content type even further. using the DEQ/DENR implementation for export.

Adding labels to the sidebar (When & Where), changing labels, and adding new fields.

**2016-07-08:** Clickable Terms ABT-680

In this update, we're making the event terms clickable.
When a user clicks on a term, it will take them back to the events listing page, results pre-filtered by that term.

Uses the Views Term Link Formatter (views_link_formatter) module which provides a formatter for Term Reference fields (i.e. Event Terms)
