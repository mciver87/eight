                In plants, the substomatal cavity is the cavity located immediately proximal to the stoma. It acts as a diffusion chamber connected with intercellular air spaces and allows rapid diffusion of carbon dioxide and other gases (such as plant pheromones) in and out of plant cells.

                Krasiński (plural: Krasińscy) is the surname of a Polish noble-aristocratic family. Because Polish adjectives have different forms for the genders, Krasińska is the form for a female family member.

                The Krasiński family had a number of soldiers, politicians (including voivodes of Poland and other members of the senate of Poland) and bishops. The family's most famous member is the 19th-century poet Zygmunt Krasiński.
